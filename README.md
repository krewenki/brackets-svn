## Features and limitations

You can find some samples of features [here](docs/FEATURES.md)

Currently **Brackets-Git** supports these features (this list may be incomplete as we add new features regularely):

- `init` / `clone` / `push` / `pull`
- `create` / `delete` / `merge` branches
- `select` / `define` / `delete` / `select` remotes
- show commits history
- manage different Git settings
- support for [Git-FTP](http://git-ftp.github.io/git-ftp/)

A comprehensive list of Brackets-Git features is avaiable reading the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).  
Most of the features available are configurable and is possible disable or enable them selectively.

**Pull/Push to password protected repositories:**
Push/Pull from and to password protected repositories is partially supported, currently it works only with `http` / `https` repositories.

[Windows Credential Store for Git](http://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/) is recommended to better manage password protected repositories till **Brackets-Git** will provide a better support for them.  
You'll need to push manually for the first time to setup your username/password into credentials helper.

If you won't find the feature you were looking for, feel free to **open issues with your ideas**.
